My Advent of Code 2022 solutions made in python

My solutions are not meant to be cool feats or technically impressive. I'm doing AoC for the fun of solving puzzles. 

I'm absolutely certain most if not all my solutions can be written more effectively or better or using some python functionality, that's nice for you.
